Let X be the n*p matrix of the centered features (the mean is substracted). n is the number of observations and p the number of features.
We want a new variable being a linear combination of the features in X such that the variance is maximized. That is, we look for Xc,
c being a scaled vector of scalars, such that the variance of ||Xc||/n is maximized. ||Xc||=(Xc)'(Xc)=c'X'Xc and n is a scalar so we want
to maximize c'X'Xc with condition ||c||=c'c=1. We introduce the function L to maximiwe with the Langragian :
L(c,λ)=c'X'Xc-λ(c'c-1)
Let's differentiate wrt c :
dL(c,λ)/dc=2X'Xc-2λc=0
=> X'Xc=λc
So c is an eigenvector of X'X wrt eigenvalue λ. By mutiplying by c' on both sides we also have :
c'λc=cX'Xc => λc'c=(Xc)'(Xc)=>λ=||Xc|| which we try to maximize.
So λ is the greatest eigenvalue of X'X.
The first principal component Xc is found by taking c as the eigenvector of X'X wrt the highest eigenvalue λ.
For the following principal components, we take next eigenvectors wrt to the corresponding eigenvalues in decreasing order. The principal
components will be orthogonal as X'X is symmetric.
